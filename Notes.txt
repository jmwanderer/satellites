Notes
-----

Working with network name spaces:

- list information about network name spaces.

sudo lsns --type=net
This will include process ids

- Enter a processes name space:

sudo nsenter -t 1530 -n ifconfig

In this case, we run ifconfig in the name space of process 1530

TODO Items for Network Simulation

- Add loopback for Groundstation
- Add static IP address route for groundstation loopback on uplink
- Add monitoring for ground stations - new column in table
- Make a config file for
  # rings
  # nodes per rind
  # distance for uplink connect

1. We have pydantic classes for use in fast api. Should we make these available to the client side also?
2. Add tests for fast api interfaces
3. Add tests for netsim functions
4. How to stop and start the mnet simulation and the physical simulation?
5. How to ensure that geosimsat runs the same data as the mininet driver?
   For right now, just use the same ring and node count when starting
