TODO Items for Network Simulation

1. We have pydantic classes for use in fast api. Should we make these available to the client side also?
2. Add tests for fast api interfaces
3. Add tests for netsim functions
4. How to stop and start the mnet simulation and the physical simulation?
5. How to ensure that geosimsat runs the same data as the mininet driver?
   For right now, just use the same ring and node count when starting
